## Star M001: MongoDB Basics

### Chapter_1_Introduction

* MongoDB Compass is the GUI tool to manager DB
* Documents are stored in collections
* A database mau contain one or more collections
* Each database and collections combinations define a namespace
* We refer to an element on Database: databaseName.collectionName.documentName

* At 'Schema' view in compas we can identfy the Value type of the elements on the Documents
* Types: strings, int32, doubles, Array, Documents, Objets, dates, 
* Can also filter the display documents
* MongoDB Documents could have Fields with Documents as Values
* Or Arrays
* And even Geospatial Data

* At Schema view we can filter collections usin JSON syntax
* Could even filter by geospatial (with a sphere centered on a dot in a map)
